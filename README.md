## Description
A simple AES implementation written with Python evolved from a workshop activity during Cyber-Trace's Cryptography path and growed into a well-maintained small project. The algorithm supports all three AES key
lengths (128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit) and provides example vectors for each key length suplied in NIST FIPS 197 with option `RunTest`.
